## Blockers

- Argument labels of public functions?
- README.md
    - Example with date.
        - Start simple,
        - Add validator,
        - Add default
- gleam.toml
- Publish

---

- Clean up tests and add a test for each kind of int, float, and text
- Still think we can have generic with_default in a way that always works, with some better system
- Have all testing rely on try_prompt and remove complex attempt-index system?

## Wild wish list

- History
- Ansi color configuration
